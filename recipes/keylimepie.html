        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups graham-cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed key-lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Key lime zest, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine graham-cracker crumbs, butter, and 3 tablespoons sugar in a medium bowl; mix well. Press into a 9-inch pie plate, and bake until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and transfer to a wire rack until completely cooled.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lower oven to 325 degrees. In a medium bowl, gently whisk together condensed milk, egg yolks, Key lime juice, and zest. Pour into the prepared, cooled crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Return pie to oven, and bake until the center is set but still quivers when the pan is nudged, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shortly before serving, combine cream and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon over cooled pie; garnish with zest. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
