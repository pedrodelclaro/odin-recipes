# odin-recipes

# part 1

This is a recipe website build as a project to The Odin Project' foundations course. In this early stage, i will only use html to build it up.

The website must:
- Be named "Odin recipes"
- Contain a homepage with links to anothes pages with recipes
- Include images in the recipes pages and headings, descriptions, an undordered list of ingredientes and an ordered list of steps
- Have three recipes
- Be submitted to github

The objective of this project is to exercise the workflow with git, github, CLI and html and also concepts such as tags, elements, links and images.

# part 2

After making a simple website with html basics, i'll use CSS to put on some style. The objective here is to pratica fundamental concepts of CSS, like cascade, syntax, selectors and basic properties.
